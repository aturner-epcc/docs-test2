## Centrally supported packages

ARCHER2 provides a number of research software packages as \*centrally
supported packages\*. Many of these packages are free to use, but others
require a license (which you, or your research group, need to supply).

The centrally supported package will usually be the current stable
release, to include major releases and significant updates. We will
usually not maintain older versions and versions no longer supported by
the developers of the package.

The following sections provide details on access to each of the
centrally supported packages:

  - `castep/castep`
  - `code-saturne/code-saturne`
  - `chemshell/chemshell`
  - `cp2k/cp2k`
  - `elk/elk`
  - `fenics/fenics`
  - `gromacs/gromacs`
  - `lammps/lammps`
  - `mo-unified-model/mo-unified-model`
  - `mitgcm/mitgcm`
  - `namd/namd`
  - `nektar++/nektar++`
  - `nemo/nemo`
  - `nwchem/nwchem`
  - `onetep/onetep`
  - `openfoam/openfoam`
  - `qe/qe`
  - `vasp/vasp`
